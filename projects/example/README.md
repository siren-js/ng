# SireNg Example

Example Angular application demonstrating `@siren-js/ng`.

## Running the App

To run the app, be sure to first build the `@siren-js/ng` library. Then you can
serve the app as normal.

```sh
ng build @siren-js/ng
ng serve -o
```

> **Note:** you will need to provide your own Siren API!

## Code Scaffolding

Be sure to include `--project example` when using [`ng generate`][ngg], or else
code will be generated in the default project (`@siren-js/ng`).

[ngg]: https://angular.io/cli/generate

## Build

Run `ng build example` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test example` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

[karma]: https://karma-runner.github.io
